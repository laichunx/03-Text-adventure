Our text adventure game

In this assignment I create a text adventure game which is about to run a burger restaurant. 
This is the map of my text adventure game:
|———————————————--------------------|
|	        [Storage]			    |
|	  	       |				    |
| [Fries]—[Burger]—[Drink]          |
|		       |			        |
|	         [Counter]		        |
|		       |				    |
|	       [FrontDoor]		        |
|		       |				    |
|	        [Casino]			    |
|———————————————--------------------|

In this assignment I create some action to let the user to process food such as:
PICK, COOK, CUT.
The original idea to end the game is when the user gain >1000 bucks.
However, in some way I cannot build the money system.
Therefore, there is no ending in my game.
Moreover, I do not have time to build the activities in Drink and Casino.
I tried to put a lot of function into the game but I cannot complete them because the lack of time. Such as Customer orders, Gamebling and Rating.
